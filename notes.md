OK

so here's my plan. 

create a react app. 

render a three js scene in a div. 

have a slider to change one three js dimension

need state to store height, width, depths, colour. 

Need to use redux. 

Need to have a component that is a slider. or whole form?

A component that is a threeJS scene.

so first - go through redux counter tutorial and modify to make a slider that updates state with redux

add the three JS stuff as a component that displays only and gets its key params from state.
